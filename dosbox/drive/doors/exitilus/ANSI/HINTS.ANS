[37mSo, you want hints, eh? Well, they might ruin your experience, but here goes:

[33m1) [32mBeware of the Novice Warriors and Mad Cows. Both are tough enemies!
[33m2) [31mAlways, Always, Always, have Armour and Weapons on you!
[33m3) [32mDo [36m*NOT* [32mmake a lot of enemies. Instead, play them like friends and use them
   for help and other materials. Then when you don't need them anymore, drop
   them and take the title of [36mEmperor[32m!
[33m4) [31mHaving a Kingdom isn't all it's cracked up to be. Make sure you keep your
   serfs happy and have a [36m*VERY* [31mlarge army!
[33m5) [32mIf you're bored and looking for a good time, try drinking or talking with
   Bryant the terrible in the Inn. You might find out some interesting things!
[33m6) [31mDon't leave home without Healing Potions...especially on Quests!
[33m7) [32mStaying at the Inn isn't completely safe....
[33m8) [31mKeep track of your money. Some people get pissed when you try to cheat them
   and might disclose facts about you!
[33m9) [32mReport all bugs to your [36mSysOp[32m. Hey, wait a second. How'd that get in here?
[33m10)[31mWhen in doubt, speak softly and carry a large club...

[37mSo, those aren't the best hints in the world, but you have to figure some thingsout on your own! So, go explore. Things aren't what they seem, and remember thatChaos Reigns Supreme in Exitilus....[0m[255D
