[0;1;36m[5C[35mDEATH!  ouch the pain, the permanent damage, the loss of your
possessions.  Why you ask, is death so painful, so destructive?
[5CBecause, well, you are a MORTAL!
[5CMortals live, mortals die.  But after the great war between Xenochia and
the mortals.  Humanoids became more peaceful (which is not saying much.)
[5CMany clerics and healers explored the topic of death.  Finally many
methods of resurrection were established.(unless you die too long.)
[5CHealers and monks travel the whole realm, they search out the wounded and
dead, and they resurrect them.  But before any perfected method of ressurection
is found, you will be permanently damaged by the painful experience.
[5CAnd sometimes, when you are out of cities (ie: fighting monsters), you
may not be lucky enough to be found by a cleric, so your soul will wander
until it is found by a cleric.  (for convenience in the game, you are always
found the next day!).
[5CYou may ask, 'if i am a cleric shouldn't i heal myself?', sorry, no, not
when you are dead.
[5CYou may also ask, 'how come i could get killed many many times a day?'
well, blame it on the clerics (not the lazy programmer, which is me).
The clerics don't know that someone's out to death match you once you get
resurrected.  So they heal you, and you get killed, they heal you again so on.
[5CIt might be a slight setback to get killed 8 times a day.  but why not
just make yourself more loved than hated???? huh??[0m[255D
