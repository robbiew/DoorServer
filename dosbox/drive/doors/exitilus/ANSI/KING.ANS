[0;1;32mThe goal of everyone in this realm is to become the final [36mEmperor. [32mThis means
that you need to be a good king first.  To be a good king doesn't simply mean tokeep a big army (although that really helps).

There many aspects you will have to worry about. The following are essential:

[5C[36m1) [32mYour underlings (potential [36mrebels[32m)
[5C[36m2) [32mOther kings
[5C[36m3) [32mInternal Management ([36mserfs [32mand [36msoldiers[32m)

When you handle these three things well, you will have great potential to be thefinal [36mEmperor[32m. (Be sure to have a good [36mquote [32mto go down in the [36mHall of Emperors[32m)

Keeping underlings happy means fair [36mtaxes [32m(not 20%) and good protection. There
will always be a few people who are just power hungry. You need to show them
your [36mpower [32mand crush them.

Relations with other kings is essential. [36mAlly [32mwith the powerful and kill the
weak to strengthen your own kingdom.

Internal management is a little more delicate. Keep your [36mserfs [32mhappy with a low
[36mtax rate [32m(which will also increase population), keep your [36mserfs [32mfed and busy
with other things to do, and do what you can with [36mcrime rates [32mand [36millegal
trades[32m.
