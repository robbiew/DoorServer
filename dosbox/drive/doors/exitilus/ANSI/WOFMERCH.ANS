[0;1;32mBecoming a merchant is profitable, and yet dangerous. To become a merchant,
you must have capital. Take your money on hand and start your investments by
buying a few [36mfarms [32mand [36msilos[32m. In Exitilus, fighting monsters is very
profitable, but will never get you the money that commerce can aquire. If you
are a rebel or a king, the money from your investmenst can support a huge army!

As rewarding as being a merchant can be, it is very volatile and fragile. As
soon as you have the money, you should start buying [36mcircuses[32m, [36miron mines[32m, and
[36mgold mines[32m, since they are much safer investments.  Beware of [36mwar[32m, because your
investments will take [36mHUGE [32mdamgage if your kingdom ever loses. Also, try not to
anger criminals, for they can easily crush your investments....

You may have always wondered about the high prices in the [36mshops[32m. After a while
of sucessful commerce, you will be able to easily afford them.

Whenever you know your kingdom will lose a war, try to sell all of your stuff.
Whenever you know your kingdom will be completely destroyed, take your money
and buy expensive [36mitems[32m. You will be able to keep them if your kingdom is
destroyed, but your money in the [36mbank [32mand [36mdeposit [32mwill be gone. You will also
lose your [36mentire manor[32m! You will only get to keep what you have on [36mhand[32m. So,
be prepared for that!

[24CGood luck with your investments![0m[255D
