                            ---------------------
Choosing a class can be more difficult than a race. Your class will decide
which guilds you can get into, how your player's alignment is, etc. Once
again, when in doubt, form a character after yourself....

Alchemists: Alchemists can't fight very well, and need good weapons just to
keep up with other characters. However, they are very good with poisons!

Warriors: The most popular race. Warriors are strong and powerful. They also
have more intelligence than other brute force characters.

Barbarians: Stronger than Warriors, but quite a bit slower. Barbarians are
good at guarding places. Nobody gets through alive.

Sorcerers: Perfect choice for players who like to snap their fingers and
watch monsters burst into flames. If you talk to yourself, chant, or believe
in magic, this is the choice for you!

Sages: Sages are just like sorcerers, but they posses white magic
capabilities. Instead of making somebody burst into flames, they can turn
a frog into a prince.

Assassins: Assassins are good fighters from a distance. They also make good
thieves and good friends. If you aren't strong enough to kill somebody, hire
an assassin to do it!

Paladins: Paladins are the good warriors. They make the kings, princes, etc.
They promote good wherever they go. If you plan on being evil, don't be a
paladin!

Clerics: Perfect Magical class which lets you heal yourself. However, clerics
are supposed to be good and not evil. And evil cleric will suffer
considerably.

Thiefs: Just the right class for those who are quick, smart, and don't have a
conscience.

Peddlers: Crap class. Peddlers are the outlets of everybody's anger. If you
just want to sit around looking for handouts or being a torn in somebody's
side, this is the class for you!

Soldiers: Soldiers are the slaves of Paladins. They have to take orders and
kill whoever they are told to. Soldiers are usually in the middle of the
alignment chart.

Ninjas: Ninja's are quick fighters who become evil very quickly. There is no
such thing as a good ninja...

Rangers: Rangers are just average humans with some healing abilities. If you
don't know what to pick, you can't go wrong with a ranger...

Monks: Monks are the all-around average class. They can fight decently, heal
themselves, and cast spells.
