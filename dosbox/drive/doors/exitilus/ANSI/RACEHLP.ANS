                             Exitilus Race Help
                            --------------------
Choosing a race is a difficult thing to do. You will have to live with it
until you commit suicide or are destroyed. When in doubt, form a character
after yourself....

Humans: You don't know about humans, just look all around you. They don't
have any bonus or weakness because of race, they are well rounded.

Elfs: Elfs are small, very bright, and quick. They are always the outlet of
anger from Dwarves and are afraid most of the time.

Trolls: Combine Bevis or Butthead with the incredible hulk, and you have a
troll. They're big and strong, but they just might try to stab a dragon with
a club.

Orcs: Orcs are a lot like trolls. They are incredibly stupid, but stronger
than a troll. However, they don't know anything about combat. Orcs also don't
like to hang around Bridges, they prefer Forests and Caves.

Gnomes: These guys are very interesting beings. They have a high resistance
to drugs, are quick, and very wise. They like to hang around mountain tops
and obscure areas of the world.

Dwarves: Dwarves are almost as stout as their ale, and love to sing about it
in 9 loud slightly out-of-tune voices. They also like to complain a lot,
especially about elves. They also make good fighters, and are respectible
with magic, if they aren't distracted "by anything looking like gold, silver,
or mithril..."

Gnolls: Gnolls are pretty weak and not very bright. They do know how to kill
somebody by use of their extremely powerful poisons. If you ever encounter a
gnoll, attempt to do combat at a safe distance...

Gargoyles: Ever seen one? Probably not. They only come out at night, and
don't like to bring a lot of attention to themselves. They are powerful, can
fly, and also posses magical capabilties.

Hobbit: Bilbo Baggins in the flesh. Small, brave, quick, and intelligent.
Pride themselves on being able to out-smart their enemies.

Mutants: Mutants are chaos theory in the flesh. You might not get hit all
day, but you might not hit anything else either.
