you register version 3.1, then you will recieve free upgrades until we
release a version 4.0 or above. If we release a version 4.0 (which is not
expected for quite some time), then you will be able to upgrade your codes
at a discounted price like v2.05 users can do with v3.1. If you have any
questions, please feel free to drop us a line!
