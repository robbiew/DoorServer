                                INTRODUCTION
                               --------------
                  Exitilus is a fantasy door game involving
                  incredible monster fights, bloody player
                  battles, merchants, thievery, trickery,
                  daring quests, large kingdoms, unimaginable
                  conquests, highly intellectual magic, skill,
                  creatures from beyond imagination, user
                  interaction, and one hell of a brave soul...

                                 DISCLAIMER

                                   UPGRADE
                                  ---------
2.05 and down:
---------------
This version of Exitilus is not compatible with Exitilus 2.05 or below.
*EVERYTHING* with File I/O and stats has been changed since ECI Software, LLC
took control of Exitilus. So, you will have to either delete your old files,
or just put this version of Exitilus into a different directory.

3.15 and down:
---------------
This version of Exitilus will require a reset if you are upgrading from
any of the beta versions. Sorry about that, but we had to add more features
to the player structure!

3.16:
------
Just unzip all the files in the 316to317.zip archive over your current v3.16
Exitilus files to upgrade. Then run upgrade.exe to move a few files around!

3.17:
-----
Copy these files into your existing Exitilus directory and run INSTALL.EXE.
This program will update the necessary files and auto run exsetup.exe to
complete the install process.

                                INSTALLATION
                               --------------
Exitilus is very easy to install. Here are the ten easy steps to get up and
running in less than one minute:

1) Create a directory for Exitilus (ie. c:\doors\exitilus)
2) Unzip all the files contained in EXITV320.ZIP into this directory.
3) Run the install.exe program and follow the prompts.
4) Exsetup program (Detailed Documentation on the exsetup program is
   included later on in this file) will begin.
5) Go into (G)ame options and change the settings to your liking. Be sure to
   set the number of kingdoms you want to have!
6) Go into (S)etup Nodes and setup your BBS Node Information.
7) (R)eset Exitilus.
8) Enter Registration Codes (if you have them).
9) Install the game into your BBS software. Examples are shown below:

Example of Singlenode Batch File:
        @ECHO OFF
        C:
        CD\DOORS\EXITILUS
        EXITILUS 1
        CD\SLBBS
        EXIT

Example of Multinode Batch File:
        @ECHO OFF
        C:
        CD\DOORS\EXITILUS
        EXITILUS %1
        CD\SLBBS
        EXIT

With the multinode batch file, be sure to run it with a parameter of the node
number. For example exbatch.bat 1 would run exitilus on node one...

10) Run exitilus N /l to test the game in local mode (where N is the number
   of a node you have already setup -- usually node 0 for local systems)

                            FILES IN THIS ARCHIVE
                           -----------------------
Here is a list of files (with descriptions) which were included in this
archive:

EXITILUS.EXE -- Main Program. Use this file to run the game.
EXSETUP.EXE  -- Setup Program. Use this file to set game options
INSTALL.EXE  -- Program to Install Exitilus
INSTALL.DOC  -- Documentation File for the Exitilus v3.20 Installer
EXEDIT.EXE   -- Exitilus Datafile Editor. This file will let you edit some of
                the available player stats, Monster.dat, Items.dat, Bar.dat,
                Spells.dat files.
EXEDIT.DOC   -- Documentation File for the Player Editor (Exedit).

                examples. Please make this file available for your users to
                download. This file contains everything a novice user needs
                to create a quest for Exitilus.
WHATS.NEW    -- File which depicts what changes were made from version-to-
                version.
SAMPLE.BAT   -- Sample Multinode Batch file to be used with Exitilus
FILE_ID.DIZ  -- File Description of Exitilus
EX-AD?.ANS   -- ANSI Files to display on your BBS promoting Exitilus. These
                files look great! We highly suggest that you use them!
*.ANS        -- ANSI Files. All these files need to be in the Exitilus ANSI
                directory so that the game can access them.
*.QST        -- Quest Files. These files are the quests that Exitilus uses.
                They need to be in the Exitilus QUESTS directory so that the
                game can use them.
*.DAT        -- Data Files. These files need to be in the Exitilus directory.
                The game will read and write to these files. Tampering with
                these files will result in corruption, which results in a
                reset.
*.TSW        -- Sample setup files.

                                 EXSETUP.EXE
                                -------------
This program lets you handle all options of the game. You need to run it at
least once to initialize the game. In this program you can enter paths,
registration codes, change game options, and edit features of the game. A
"map" of the setup program follows.

---------
Welcome to Exitilus Setup v3.17!

(F)ix Player.dat File

(Q)uit and Save
Please Choose:

---------
(G)ame Options - Use this option to configure SysOp options for the game.
Run the above option First!

After running this command, you will be prompted with this menu:

Game Options
------------
(1)Minimum Monster Fights: 10
(2)Maximum Monster Fights: 20
(3)Player Fights per day: 3
(4)Bank Interest: 5%
(5)Inactivity Player Delete (in days): 0

(7)Number of Kingdoms: 4
(8)Allow Players to Play the Same Quest Multiple Times: No
(9)Death Style: New
(D)Death Matches: Allowed
(G)Starting Gold: $2000
(F)Fight Level Difference: 30%
(A)ASCII Bulletin File: bulletin.txt
(S)External ASCII Score File: scores.txt
(C)Clear Tavern Message Board
(*)Reset Game Options
(Q)uit to Main Menu
Please Choose:

The number of monster fights a player gets per day is randomized between the
numbers you put in with options 1 and 2.

The number of player-to-player fights per day is option 3.

The Bank interest is calculated daily when maintenance is run. Use option 4
to edit the interest.

Option 5 lets you specify the number of days until a user is deleted for not
playing. Giving this option a value of '0' will disable this function.

Option 6 lets you specify the amount of time the game will wait for input
from the player before exiting (in seconds). Giving this option a value of
'0' will disable this function.

Option 7 will set the number of kingdoms to start out with in the game. This
setting is very important. Be sure to read the information it puts on the
screen!

Option 8 allows you to decide if you want your users to be able to play the
same quest multiple times. If you don't want them to, then the game will tell
the user that they have already played that quest and can't play it again. If
you let them play quests multiple times, then the game will remind the player
that they have already played this quest and ask if they want to continue.

Option 9 allows you to set the death mode. Setting this to OLD mode will let
players be killed unlimited number of times. Setting this to NEW mode will
only let players die once per day (with the rare ressurection case).

Option D will let you decide if you want to let people to Death Match other
players. Death Matches are very fatal to the losing party and let the
winning party take some of the losing party's inventory.

Option G will let you specify the amount of Gold players get when they
create a new character.

Option F will let you specify the amount of difference between levels a
player can fight. For example, if it's set to 30%, then a level 100 player
can only attack level 70 and above players.

Option A will specify the name of a bulletin file which is a version
of the world news in plain text. This file will be updated everytime new
news happens.

Option S is not implemented yet.

Option C will clear the message board which is located in the Tavern. This
never has to be run, but if the message board gets lenghty, it's good to run
it....

The '*' option will delete the current exitilus.dat file and re-create it
with default values. This is good to run if your settings aren't being saved
or other weird things are happening in the game.
---------
(D)elete Players - Use this option to delete any unwanted or misbehaving
players (or to just annoy your friends. =) ). A list of players will appear
when you press this option. Enter the player's number and then confirm the
deletion and the player is gone.
---------
(A)dd Items - Use this option to add an item into the item.dat file. You may
then give this item to a player by using a quest. See the quest documentation
for more info on adding items.
---------
(F)ix Player.dat File - Use this option to have the game check through it's
player.dat file and fix any negative numbers and other problems which might
occur during game play. Only use this option if you feel something isn't
correct in the game.
---------
(S)etup Node(s) - Use this option to enter the paths to the drop file,
Exitilus, and BBS Path for each node. Run this option second!

After executing this option, you will be prompted for which node you want to
change/setup. If you are installing this game for the first time, just enter
0 for the starting node. You are then prompted with this menu:

Node 0 Configuration!

(D)rop File Path and Name: e:\exitilus\door.sys
(E)xitilus Path: e:\exitilus
(B)BS Path: e:\exitilus
(C)omport Settings: Read from Drop File
(I)RQ Settings: Standard
(L)ocked Baud Rate: Port Not Locked
(F)osill Routines: Fosill Driver
(N)ext Node Number
(P)revious Node Number
(Q)uit to Main Menu

Please Choose:

The Drop File Path and Name field is where your drop file is stored on your
hard drive. You have to enter the path and drop file name. Supported drop
file types are:
        *door.sys       Gap/Generic
        *dorinfox.def   RBBS-PC/Early Searchlight
        *pcboard.sys    PC-Board
        *callinfo.bbs   Wildcat!
        *chain.txt      WWIV
        *exitinfo.bbs   Remote Access
        *sfdoors.dat    Spitfire
An example of an entry is: c:\exitilus\door.sys

The Exitilus File Path field is where the Exitilus data files reside. You
do not need to enter the trailing backslash ('\'). An example entry is:
c:\exitilus

The BBS Path field is where your BBS files are located. You also do not need
to enter the trailing backslash ('\'). An example entry is: c:\bbs

The Comport Settings let you specify whether you want Exitilus to read the
comport number from the drop file or specify a specific comport. You should
only change this option if you can non-standard ComPort Settings and can't
use a fossil driver.

The IRQ Settings are the same as teh comport settings, only they apply to
IRQs.

The Locked Baud rate can be set using this option.

Fossil Routines are automatically detected and used if found. If you don't
want Exitilus to use a fossil, then set this option to No.

The Next Node option will move to the next node.

The Previous Node option will move to the previous node.

Return to the Main Menu will save the data file for the current node and
return you to the Main Menu.
---------
(R)eset Exitilus - Use this option to create the necessary files and reset
all the datafiles. This option will destroy all user data, so use it with
caution. You are to run this option third in a new setup.

When you choose to reset the game, it will prompt you for assurance. If you
say yes, there is no way to get the data files back. So, use this option
with caution.
---------
(E)nter Registration Codes - Use this option to enter registration codes,
if you've registered the game. You will get a menu like the below:

Registration Information:
(S)ysOp Name:
(B)BS Name:
(R)egistration Code:
(Q)uit to Main Menu

This game is UNREGISTERED! Please Register Soon!

Which Option?

If you have your registration code, then enter you SysOp Name, BBS Name, and
Registration Code *EXACTLY* as it appears on your registration form. The
Codes ARE CASE SENSITIVE! If you entered your codes correctly, then the menu
will change to say:

This game is REGISTERED! Thanks for your Support!

If you tried to enter you codes and they didn't work, please contact us and
we will try to fix them ASAP! For more registration information, see the file
register.frm.

Also note that the registration routines have changed from v3.15 and below.
You will be receiving new registration codes within one week (if you have
already registered Exitilus).
---------
(Q)uit and Save - Use this option to exit the setup program and save all
the changes you made.
---------
That's all there is to the exsetup program. Please give us some ideas on
what you would like to be able to configure!

                               EXTRA FUNCTIONS
                              -----------------
Exitilus.exe is able to take a few parameters. Those parameters are listed
below:

Exitilus N --  Where N is the node number you are running Exitilus off of.
               This parameter is required to run Exitilus!

Exitilus N /l --  Where N is the node number, and /l tells Exitilus to run
                  locally.

Exitilus /M  --  Forces Exitilus to run maintenance (not normally needed,
                 because Exitilus runs maintenance when the first player
                 of the day runs the game)
              
                                OTHER NOTES
                               -------------
Exitilus is MultiNode compatible. It will run simotaneously on more than one
node. It locks certain files when opening them. If you get errors like can't
access player.dat file, then it means that another node is using the file.
You can usually ignore these, unless it happens quite often. Then make sure
you have share loaded with enough files to be able to open (100ish?).

Exitilus is year 2000 compliant. Exitilus uses the 4-digit date system. So
you shouldn't notice any change when the century changes.

If you try to enter the game and it says that it's running maintenance, and
it isn't, then delete the file called maintain.flg.

If it says that a user is online, yet they aren't, you can force maintenance,
or it will reset the flag the next day or the next time the user comes online.

Exitilus can and will use a fossil driver. If you load a fossil anytime
before you run exitilus.exe, Exitilus will auto-detect it and begin using the
fossil. This is useful if you run a telnet BBS or have weird IRQ/COM PORT
settings.

Exitilus does have limits on stats. The error checking would be extremely
difficult for every area of the game. We error check in quite a few areas,
but not all of them. So, here are the limitations of the game. Exceeding them
will most likely cause your stats to go into the negatives and will require
a reset to fix them. We have made every attempt to make sure that that won't
happen, but you can't protect everything... On all "standard" stats (like
strength, defense, agility, hitpoints, etc), there is a 30,000 max limit. On
all money and experience variables there is a 18-digit max limit. That's
somewhere in the quadrillions, if we're not mistaken. It would be very RARE
for anybody to get that high, but somebody could.

Quests are a very delicate part of Exitilus. They can easily screw up a game
and/or cause file corruption. The best way to safeguard yourself is to check
quests BEFORE you put them into the game. ECI Software, LLC has a web page
where members of the Exitilus Quest Team create excellent quests. These
quests are high quality quests (the best, if you ask us). So, please take a
look at them!

                                REGISTRATION
                               --------------

This version of Exitilus will run fine for 15 days. After which features will
drop out and an annoying delay on exit will be implemented. You may continue
to use the game for another 15 days, but must register it before then or
discontinue it's usage.

To register this game, please see the register.frm file included in this
archive. You may register via US check or money order. Please see the
register.frm file for more information.

Show that you support the shareware concept and Exitilus by registering. It
doesn't cost much and it's well worth it for a game like this...

             WAYS TO LOWER THE CHANCE OF PLAYER FILE CORRUPTION
            ----------------------------------------------------
Player File Corruption usually doesn't happen, but when it does, it requires
a reset to fix. So, it's not a fun thing to have happen. Listed below are
some ways you can lower your chance of that happening...

1) Check Quests. Always make sure Quests aren't going away giving 10,000
   strength or something like that. There are some people out there who will
   try to write a quest to make them level faster. Don't put up those quests.
   That's your best and only defense. Quests have more potential than any
   other area of the game to cause file corruption. We have taken many
   measures to make sure that won't happen, but there's always a way...
2) Watch the game. If somebody suddenly becomes strong, ask them about it.
   Maybe there's a bug or something else that we don't know about...
3) Play. If you play yourself, you are more likely to realize problems and
   be able to stop them while they can still be stopped.

That's about it. As you can see, quests are Exitilus's most vulnerable spot
for corruption. So, for best results with the game, only use Quests from
an Exitilus Quest Team Member.

                                  PROBLEMS
                                 ----------
If you ever encounter any problems in this game, please do the following:

1) Read this entire file and make sure you set everything up correctly
2) Check our Q&A Web Page at www.ecisoftware.com. There is a Q&A file
   included with Exitilus, but it's usually not as current as the one on the
   website.
3) If you are still having problems, please contact ECI Software, LLC at the
   addresses listed at the bottom of this file.

There shouldn't be any problems, but if they do arise, please don't hesitate
to contact us!

                                NOTE FROM ROB
                               ---------------
I would just like to personally thank you for using this product. We have put
a lot of time and effort into making sure it is as good as it can be. Let me
also say that we are not done with this game. We intend to keep adding
features, fixing bugs, and supporting this product for many years to come. If
you ever have any problems, please don't hesitate to contact us. We love
hearing from people and are always willing to help out. I hope you enjoy the
game and if you ever find yourself talking to the bartender, you may want to
ask him about FIGHTS. Anyway, have a great time and let us know if you have
any problems!
