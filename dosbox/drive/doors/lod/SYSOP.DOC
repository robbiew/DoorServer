System Requirements
-------------------
       LOD is a very hardware-hungry program. To get the full configuration
operating (SVGA graphics and MOD Music), you'll need a pretty significant
setup.

       I do not recommend using LOD under desqview, but it can be done. I
would suggest that if you do so, you restrict yourself to operating LOD in
text mode. I do not own a copy of desqview and thus cannot test LOD under
that environment.

       *** CPU

       Any 80286 or greater should function with LOD in TEXT mode, but
you'll need at least a 80386/33 for reasonable performace in the SVGA
graphics mode. LOD's graphics routines use embedded 386 assembly
instructions and therefore a 286 just won't work with graphics enabled.

       *** VIDEO CARD

       LOD can be operated in either TEXT or SVGA mode. Any old graphics
adapter will work for text mode, but SVGA requires a graphics adapter
capable of supporting 800x600x256 SVGA graphics. The graphics adapter
must have at least 512k memory on board, and should support the VESA video
bios standard. The program VGATEST is included to test whether an adapter
is supported by LOD or not.

       If 800x600x256 is not available, then LOD will attempt to fall back
to 640x480x256. The 640x480 mode does not include nearly as much information
as 800x600 and is not recommended unless absolutely necessary.

       *** DISK SPACE

       A hard drive is required. LOD doesn't use too much space beyond
what is stored inside the zip files, so if you can uncompress the thing
and still have about a meg left, then you ought to be safe.

       *** MEMORY

       This depends significantly on the installation that you perform.
Running LOD in TEXT mode uses the least amount of memory. Operating in
SVGA graphics mode will add about 30-50k to the requirements. MOD Music
support requires that you either have EMS memory available or run the
DPMI version of LOD.

       The basic conventional memory requirement for LOD/TEXT is 450k.
LOD/SVGA is 500k. If you use the /EMS switch on LOD's command line, then
LOD will load some data into EMS memory, reducing the memory requirements
slightly.

       *** MODEM

       Most of LOD's game play involves moving about in the wastelands.
When this occurs, the user's display must be updated quickly. The better
the modem, the faster this happens. I recommend using at least a 9600
baud modem.

       *** SOUND CARD

       LOD should operate on a Sound Blaster 16, 1.x, 2.0, pro, the
Media Vision Pro Audio Spectrum, Gravis Ultrasound, or any sound card
compatible with those standards.

Quick Installation
------------------

  A) Create a directory on your disk to contain LOD and change dir to
     it. (e.g. "MD \LOD" and "CD \LOD")

  B) Unzip the required archive files. A chart at the end of this section
     lists which files are required for a particular installation. You can
     never go wrong by unzipping too much, but if certain files are -missing-,
     then certain components may not work.

  C) If you are running LOD with a bbs system, then you will need to edit
     GAME.CTL to set up the required interface to the bbs software. In
     particular you will wish to modify the following items:

        SYSOPFIRST, SYSOPLAST - your first & last name
        BBSNAME - the name of your bbs
        BBSTYPE - the type of "drop file" that is created by your bbs
        LOCKBAUD - a locked baud rate, if applicable

     The default DOS setup is configured to operate with a fossil driver. If
     you are not running a fossil driver, then you will need to uncomment
     the ";INTERNAL" line in game.ctl.

     There may be more options of interest to you in GAME.CTL. I suggest
     thoroughly reading that file.

  D) If you are running LOD with a bbs system, then you will also need
     to create the proper batch files to interface with your bbs. Please
     see the documentation included with your bbs software for more
     information.

     Basically, the batch file should change to lod's directory, optionally
     copy the drop file to that directory, invoke GAME.EXE with various
     parameters, and finally change dir back to your bbs and exit.

  E) For a quick local logon, you can load up LOD with the /L switch.
     For example, "GAME.EXE /L" or "GAME.EXE /VGA /L". This can be a
     quick way to test and make sure that LOD itself is operating
     properly.

Command Line Switches
---------------------

     /L       Load in Local mode.

     /S       Sysop fast log on. (uses sysop name in GAME.CTL)

     /M       Force maintenance run. (Unnecessary unless "NOAUTOMAINT" is
              present in GAME.CTL)

     /VGA     Displays VGA GRAPHICS on sysop's computer.

     /640     Force LOD to operate in 640x480x256 instead of 800x600x256.
              This option is handy if your monitor does not support 800x600
              yet you still wish to operate in graphics mode.

  /LARGEFONT  This will cause LOD to use an 8x12 font in SVGA mode rather
              than the defaut 8x8 font. The 8x12 font is significantly
              larger and may be easier for some people to read. However, the
              inventory display will be reduced to displaying only one
              line (6 items). May be abbreviated "/LF"

   /HUGEFONT  This will cuase LOD to use an 8x14 font in SVGA mode. It is
              much larger than the standard font and may be more easily
              readable by some people. The entire bottom inventory display
              will be dropped however. May be abbreviated "/HF"

    /NOACCEL  Disables checking for S3 accelerator chip in SVGA mode. If
              SVGA mode yields unpredictable results or lockups then you
              may wish to use this option. May be abbreiviated "/NA".

     /NOVESA  Disables use of VESA Bios extensions. LOD includes limited
              support for a few SVGA adapaters. This will cause LOD to
              attemp to use the adapter directly rather than going through
              the VBE. You try running VGATEST with the /NOVESA flag
              before trying it under LOD. May be abbreviated "/NV".

   /FORCEINT  Forces LOD to use an interrupt based VESA flipper rather than
              a call based VESA flipper. Use it if VGATEST tells you to.
              May be abbreviated "/FI"

  /FORCEDUAL  Forces LOD to use a dual page based VESA flipper rather than
              a single page based VESA flipper. Use it if VGATEST tells you
              to. May be abbreviated "/FD".

     /EMS     Use ems memory if available.

   /SERHANDx  [OS/2 version only!] "x" is assumed to be the file handle
              number of an open serial port. You'll probably need to do
              this with maximus/2.

     /Nx      Specifies node number. (i.e. /N1 for node 1, /N2 for node 2,
              etc)

     /Pyy     Specifies path to drop files. (i.e. /PC:\BBS, for c:\bbs, etc)

     /CHECK   Perform multinode check (see multinode use below)

     /Bxxxx   Specify lock baud rate. For example, "/B38400" would force the
              com port to be 38,400 baud no matter what the drop file (i.e.
              DORINFOx.DEF) says the baud is.

     /?       Display a brief command line option summary.

     /OVREMS  Will cause LOD to attempt to load its overlay into EMS memory
              if possible.

/REMOTEDIAGS  Allows "remote" users to use the diagnostics menu if they have
              the Diagnostics flag set in their user record. The diagnostics
              flag may be set by using the "Prefs" button in the user editor
              in GAMEEDIT.EXE.

              Lod's diagnostics menu is invoked by pressing "|" at the
              wastelands prompt. (User must have diagnostics flag set!)


   /AUDIOxxx  For DOS and DPMI versions only. Initializes the MOD music
              system. See the section below entitled "audio support"
              for more details. Valid codes are:

                 /AUDIOSB:    SoundBlaster 1.x
                 /AUDIOSB1X:  SoundBlaster 1.x (same as /AUDIOSB)
                 /AUDIOSB2X:  SoundBlaster 2.x
                 /AUDIOSBPRO: SoundBlaster Pro
                 /AUDIOPAS:   Pro Audio Spectrum
                 /AUDIOGUS:   Gravis Ultrasound

              This option requires LODxxxF.ZIP.

     /IRQx    Specify Sound Card IRQ level (SB Default=5)

     /DMAx    Specify Sound Card DMA level (SB Default=1)

     /BASExxx Specify Sound Card BASEIO, in hexadecimal (SB Default=220)

     /FR      Play audio when remote users are on. By default, LOD will
              NOT play music on the sysops machine when the caller is
              on from REMOTE. This is done to not wake up the sysop in
              the middle of the night when a player enters the game! However,
              if you want the music to play no matter whether the user
              is on locally, or remotely, then you can use this switch.

Examples
--------
  "GAME /L /EMS /VGA"

      Loads LOD in local mode with VGA graphics active and EMS memory
      will be used if available.

  "GAME /N1 /EMS /VGA /PI:\MAX /B38400"

      Loads LOD in remote mode with VGA graphics active. EMS memory will be
      used if available. Node #1 has been selected (i.e. DORINFO1.DEF or
      DOOR1.SYS will be used). The drop file will be searched for in the
      path I:\MAX. The baud rate will be locked to 38,400

  "GAME /L /EMS /VGA /AUDIOSB"

      Load locally, enable VGA graphics, use EMS if available, and use
      soundblaster 1.x audio.

  "GAME /L /EMS /VGA /AUDIOSB16 /IRQ5 /DMA1 /BASE220"

      Load locally, using VGA graphics and EMS, and use SoundBlaster 16
      audio at irq=5, dma=1, and base address = 220.

Glossary
--------
     Here's the definitions of a few terms that I will be using quite
 frequently in this document.

     640x480x256 -  This mode is also supported by LOD. Not all information
                    that is present in 800x600 is available, but this mode
                    can be used in the case that you do not support 800x600.
                    640x480 does still require a SVGA adapter, but you can
                    probably get by with a normal VGA monitor.

     800x600x256 -  This is the video mode at which the VGA version of LOD
                    operates. Specifically, it is 800 pixels horizontal,
                    600 pixels vertical, and each color is chosen from a
                    256 color palette. An 800x600 screen requires 480,000
                    bytes of video memory and thus should operate on a SVGA
                    card with 512k or more of memory.

     Baud -         The speed at which the user is calling.

     DORINFOx.DEF - Common drop file used by a variety of bbs programs. It is
                    the most extensively tested drop file format in LOD, and
                    therefore, the most reliable.

     Drop File - The file that is created by the bbs program when it goes to
                 execute the door. It contains the baud rate, com port,
                 name of the user online, etc. Common drop files are
                 DORINFO.DEF, DOOR.SYS, PCBOARD.SYS, EXITINFO.DAT, etc.

     EGA - "Enhanced Graphics Adapter". The graphics standard that LOD
           and GTERM used to use. We have since upgraded to SVGA. Most
           modern video adapters (VGA, SVGA, etc) also support the EGA
           modes. EGA support is no longer available with LOD 4.20 and
           above. [See also: VGA, SVGA]

     EMS - "Expanded Memory Specification". If your machine has over 1
           megabyte of memory, then you may have some available. LOD can
           utilize EMS to improve game performance and reduce conventional
           memory requirements.

     Locked Baud - In order to get the most efficiency out of a high speed
                   error correcting modem (9600 baud or above), then you may
                   lock the baud rate to a speed higher than what the caller
                   is actually using. By locking the baud to 38,400, the
                   modem can actually compress the data that is being sent
                   and achieve a baud rate much higher than the actual
                   transmission rate. Please see the section on high speed/
                   locked bauds below.

     LOD - "Land Of Devastation", the name of the game you are trying to
           install!

     MOD - A commonly used music file format. Most MOD songs are high
           quality four voice with digital effects. Land Of Devastation
           uses MODs for it's music.

     Maint - Maintenance mode. LOD must perform maintenance once per day to
             do various things with it's data files. See the section below
             on maintenance.

     Multinode - A bbs system with either more than one computer attached
                 or using a multi tasker (desqview, windows) that allows
                 more than one person to call at a time.

     Node - Refers to a member of a multinode system.

     Overlay - A file included with LOD (either GAME.OVR or GAMEEGA.OVR)
               which is used to keep portions of the program on disk to
               reduce memory requirements. It is all automatic and you should
               not need to worry about it.

     Sound Blaster - A common sound card that is installed in many computers.
                     The Sound Blaster card is produced by Creative Labs and
                     includes support for both music and digital voice
                     effects. Several other cards are available that are
                     "compatible" with the Sound Blaster standard, such
                     as the Thunderboard and the Pro Audio Spectrum.

     SVGA - "Super VGA". A generic term that applies to graphics adapters
            that support higher resolutions and/or colors than the VGA
            standard supports. LOD _requires_ an SVGA adapter with 512k+
            of memory to operate in graphics mode.

     VESA - A popular standard for SVGA cards. LOD supports VESA graphics
            in the 800x600x256 and 640x480x256 modes. The 800x600x256
            mode is preferred and LOD will use that mode if available.

     VGA -  "Video Graphics Array". A graphics standard supporting resolutions
            up to approximately 640x480x16 and 320x200x256. Most current
            graphics adapters are actually SVGA cards supporting more
            advanced modes. In this document, I tend to use the term VGA
            interchangeably with SVGA. [See also: SVGA]

VGA Graphics Version
--------------------

     LOD has been designed with _optional_ VGA graphics to enhance the
 playing experience. By default, LOD will load with just the plain text
 graphics.

     To enable the VGA graphics, you must use the "/VGA" switch on the
 command line. For example, "GAME /L /VGA". VGA graphics do consume more
 memory and may not run on your computer. If you have trouble, you may
 wish to try using the "/EMS" switch described below under "memory
 requirements".

     To utilize VGA graphics, LOD requires a video card capable of supporting
 800x600x256 graphics. Most modern cards with 512k or more of memory do
 support this mode. LOD also requires a card that supports the VESA video
 bios standard. Most newer cards incorporate this standard directly, and
 drivers are available for some of the older cards.

     It is possible that your current video card may not support
 800x600x256 graphics. In this case, you will have to run LOD in text
 mode. I'm sorry for the inconvenience to those who are running video cards
 incapable of supporting this mode, but tailoring LOD to a particular
 video mode is very difficult and for me to maintain support for multiple
 video resolutions would be nearly impossible.

     A program called "VGATEST" has been included in LODxxxC.ZIP. This
 program will report on whether or not your card supports SVGA800x600x256
 and perform a simple test and benchmark.

     NOTE: By using VGA graphics on the sysop side, you are not "forcing"
 your users to use VGA graphics too. The remote user graphics are totally
 independent of the sysop's graphics.


Memory Requirements
-------------------

 NOTE: A runtime error 203 or 253 indicates insufficient memory!

     LOD can be adequately described as a "memory hog". LOD likes as much
 memory as you can give it. LOD's memory requirements differ depending on
 the configuration that you use.

     TEXT version (GAME.EXE without /VGA):

        The lowest possible memory requirements. No VGA graphics will be
        displayed on the sysop's side, but your users can still have ega
        if they use the gterm terminal program.

        I suggest running the text version if all else fails.

     GRAPHICS version (GAME.EXE with /VGA):

        Consumes substantially more memory, but gives the sysop a nice
        pretty EGA display, similar to what the user with gterm sees. If
        you have memory troubles, try using the /EMS switch.

     GRAPHICS and SOUND (GAME.EXE with /VGA and /AUDIOSB):

        Gobbles up an immense amount of memory. Using the /EMS switch is
        a necessity to give LOD access to EMS memory so it can store some
        data up there.

 --> What is EMS memory?

     EMS memory stands for "expanding memory specification". It is a way
 for your computer to use memory above the standard 640k that dos has. LOD
 is capable of storing some of it's data in EMS memory, thus freeing up
 more space in the lower 640k for sound and graphics.

     Most computers provide EMS memory with a special driver in their
 config.sys file - QEMM, EMM386, and 386MAX are popular ones. Most 386+
 computers have EMS memory. If you are using DOS 5.0 or greater, then you
 can type "MEM" to get a display about how much EMS memory you have.

     LOD must be EXPLICITLY TOLD TO USE EMS. For compatibility reasons,
 LOD won't use it by default. You must place the switch "/EMS" on the
 command line when you invoke game.exe. For example, "GAME /L /EMS".

     If you aren't sure whether you have EMS memory, then try using the
 /EMS switch anyway - it can't hurt anything.

 --> What about EXTENDED (XMS) memory?

     To use LOD with extended memory, you will need to use the DPMI version
 of LOD. This is located in the archive LODxxxP.ZIP and the executable is
 called GAME_DPM.EXE. It supports all of the functionality of the plain
 dos version, but it does operate in protected mode and will make use of
 extended memory.

Audio Support
-------------
     Starting with version 3.60, Land Of Devastation and GTERM now have some
 sound/music capability. Here is how to get the sound system to work:

     1) You must have downloaded and unarchived LODxxxF.ZIP into the
        directory where you are running LOD (or GTERM).

     2) You must use one of the /AUDIOxxx options, for example
        "/AUDIOSB" for generic SoundBlaster 1.x support.

     3) If you do not specify any "/IRQ", "/DMA", and "/BASE" options,
        then the IRQ, DMA, and BASE will be auto-detected. If the
        autodetection does not work, then you may wish to specify the
        values directly.

     4) If you're using the DPMI version of LOD (GAME_DPM.EXE), then
        you MUST specify the IRQ and DMA parameters. Autodetection (at
        least on my system) does not function in DPMI mode.

        Also, with GAME_DPM.EXE, you must specify the following line
        in the batch file that calls LOD (or GTERM):

           SET RTM=REALLEAVE 14336

        A sample dpmi batch file is provided called "DPMI_AUD.BAT" in
        LODxxxP.ZIP.

     Examples: (For Land Of Devastation - on the sysop's side)

        "GAME /L /EMS /EGA /AUDIOSB"
          Load LOD with Soundblaster 1.x enabled.  IRQ, DMA, and BASEIO
          will be autodetected.

        "GAME /L /EMS /EGA /AUDIOGUS /IRQ5 /FR"
          Load LOD with Gravis Ultrasound at IRQ 5, force music to play
          when remote users are on.  DMA and BASEIO will be autodetected.

     Examples: (For GTERM - on the remote user's side)

        "GTERM COM 2 BAUD 19200 /AUDIOPAS"
          Load GTERM with ProAudioSpectrum set.

        "GTERM COM 1 BAUD 2400 /AUDIOSB16 /BASE220 /IRQ5 /DMA1"
          Load GTERM with soundblaster at base=220, irq=5, and dma=1.


 Notes:

     We are now using a new Audio system.  It hasn't been tested a whole
 lot and may have problems.  It does support STEREO and 16-bit cards
 whereas the previous routines we were using do not.

     If you have trouble running LOD with audio support, then shut it
 off!

     The audio system eats up quite a bit of memory (almost 150k). Therefore,
 when running LOD or GTERM, you might not have enough conventional memory to
 initialize the audio system and you won't hear anything.

     Having music active on one side does not require having music active
 on the other. For example, a user with GTERM might have music enabled, but
 the sysop might have it disabled - this will work fine - the user will hear
 his music and the sysop will have some nice silence!

     If you like, you can bring up a display of the current MOD system
 status (also shows any possible errors) by pressing ALT-3. This works with
 either GTERM or the EGA (GAME /EGA) version of LOD. The non-EGA
 version of LOD does not have the mod status screen.


 Music system credits:

     Our original MOD support was provided by Mark J Cox's excellent
 MOD-OBJ package.

     Our current MOD support (i.e. the GDM and MSE files) were provided
 by Edward Schlunder's BWSB package.

     Most (if not all!) of our songs were composed by Chris Azure.


Multinode use
-------------
     LOD does NOT allow multinode use. Furthermore, I have no future plans
 to develop a version of LOD that does at this time. However, LOD can be
 set to "lock out" other nodes while one node is playing. (i.e. Node 1
 is playing so nodes 2 & 3 cannot).
     This is done using the /Nx and /CHECK switches. /Nx tells which node
 number is using the door. (i.e. "GAME /N2 /CHECK" would be for node 2).
 And /CHECK says to check for multinode use.
     The start up commands for LOD for a 2-node system would be as follows:

     NODE 1: Game /N1 /CHECK

     NODE 2: Game /N2 /CHECK

     When LOD encounters another player trying to play while one is already
 playing it will spew out the file "LODLOK.TXT" to the user to explain the
 situation to him.

     NOTE: Apparently, there is some kind of "glitch" in either Turbo Pascal
           or DOS which causes "sharing violations" to occur when LOD is
           activated by more than one person. If you have this problem, then
           you may wish to try to set the "read-only" bit on the executable
           files (i.e. GAME.EXE,GAME.OVR,GAMEEGA.EXE,GAMEEGA.OVR).

           You can do this by typing the following: "ATTRIB +R GAME.EXE".


Common Problems (Locked Bauds, High Speed modems, Music, etc)
-------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTE: If you are having a communications-related problem, and you are
        not using a fossil driver, then I suggest you try using a fossil
        if it is possible.

     If you are running a high speed modem (9600 baud or above), then I
  suggest you run your bbs/mailer/doors at a locked baud rate. On high
  speed error correcting modems, locking the baud rate will have a noticeable
  increase on the speed of text that is sent. It's beyond the scope of
  these docs to discuss configuring your bbs and mailer for a locked baud
  rate; you may wish consult those docs for information on that. Here
  are a few things to keep in mind when setting up LOD with a locked
  baud rate:

     #1: You may need to use the /B switch on the LOD command line to specify
         the locked baud. For 19,200 this would be "/B19200" and for 38,400
         this would be "/B38400". Please note there is no space between the
         /B and the baud rate. This is only necessary in some instances. First
         try LOD without the switch and then add the switch and see what
         happens.

     #2: When using a locked baud rate, I highly recommend using a FOSSIL
         driver. In fact, I don't even know if LOD will work at high speeds
         without one. BNU is a good fossil driver which can even be loaded
         and unloaded before/after you run LOD.

     #3: If you are using a fossil, then make sure to tell the fossil that
         the port is locked. For BNU, to lock com1: at 38,400, you would
         use something like "L0=38400" on BNU's command line.

     #4: Please note: If you lock the baud for one program, it must be locked
         for everything. You can't lock the baud for just LOD, but not
         your bbs/mailer.

     If you are running at high speeds without locking the baud rate, then
  LOD should function fine. Without a locked baud, there should be no need
  for the use of the /Bxxxx switch.

     What follows is some information on possible strange situations that
  may occur:

     #1: Low speed users can play LOD, but high speed users get garbage.

             - If you are not using the DORINFOx.DEF or DOOR.SYS drop file
               then you may wish to find a converter program to convert
               whatever drop file your bbs produces to the DORINFOx.DEF
               or DOOR.SYS format and tell LOD to use that.

               Several converter programs are readily available on most
               bbs systems. QKDoor is a good one if you can find it.

             - If you are not using a fossil (i.e. you have LOD's "internal"
               line un commented in GAME.CTL), then I suggest trying a fossil.

     #2: High speed users can play LOD, but low speed users get garbage.

             - You may be specifying the /Bxxxx parameter when you don't
               need to. Only use /Bxxxx if you are using LOD with a locked
               baud rate.

     #3: Everyone gets garbage!

             - You may be using the /Bxxxx parameter when it's not needed,
               or you may have the the wrong baud rate specified in the
               /Bxxxx parameter.

             - Try switching to DORINFOx.DEF as described in #1 above.

             - Try using a fossil (make sure the "INTERNAL" line in
               GAME.CTL is commented out.

     #4: LOD hangs up when a user enters the game.

             - Sounds like LOD is getting the wrong baud rate somehow.
               Try switching over to the DORINFOx.DEF drop file method
               if possible.

     #5: Text and screens are getting cut off.

             - If you are running with a locked baud, then this could
               be caused by some sort of FLOW CONTROL problem. Try using
               a fossil if you aren't already.

     General trouble shooting hints: The following may help you clear up
  some of the problems outlined above:

     #1: You can use the ALT-D command in the EGA (GAME /EGA) version
         of LOD or the ALT-I command in the normal (GAME.EXE) version of
         LOD to get a display of the current serial port setup.

         If what is displayed differs greatly from what it should be,
         then you've found your problem!

     #2: If you're using something other than the DORINFOx.DEF drop file,
         then I always suggest trying to use DORINFOx.DEF if possible. It is
         the most reliable method and has had the most testing.

     Problems related to the sound system:

     #1: When remote users log on and the /FR option is enabled, the system
         hangs.

               a) Remove the /FR option (you probably don't want music
                  playing while remote users are on anyway)

     #2: Whenever I use sound (with /AUDIOSB, etc..) options, LOD locks
         up in the game.

               a) Try manually specifying irq/dma/baseio settings.

               b) If sound keeps locking up your computer, then you may
                  have to simply not use the sound capability. There are
                  huge variations in computer hardware, sound cards in
                  particular and LOD just isn't compatible with everything.


Restarting the Game
-------------------
     To manually reset the game, you can use the supplied program RESET.EXE.
 This will automatically delete all of the proper files. You should use this
 method rather than deleting the *.DAT files yourself, since some files,
 such as LODREG.DAT, should not be deleted.

     There is a provision in the game for the users to reset the game
 themselves when all of the puritron parts have been retrieved. But, if your
 users do not reset the game themselves, then the above method will work.

     If you want to configure with another Data Set, then see the section
 on Data Sets below.


Alternate Data Sets
-------------------
     With recent versions of LOD, I have put into effect the concept of data
 sets. A Data Set includes it's own maps, monsters, NPCs, cities, and other
 items. Most Data Sets are written by sysops who like to customize LOD.
 Information on creating custom data sets is contained in LODxxxE.ZIP.

     I have requested that game designers follow a standardized naming
 convention for LOD data sets. The format is a four character name followed
 by the version number of LOD that it was written for. For example,
 FUTR361.ZIP would be for the "future" data set, compiled for LOD version
 3.61.

     IMPORTANT! When switching to a new data set, you will probably need
 to re-start the LOD game (by running RESET.EXE). Most new data sets include
 an entirely new map and possibly new inventory items. Just dropping
 a new data set into an existing game could really screw things up.

     To install an alternate data set, just unzip the file into your LOD
 directory and over-write and existing files. Most likely you'll see a
 GAME.DEF be unzipped and possibly a ANSI.DEF or a GTSTRS.DEF. Remember,
 you'll probably need to restart the game by running RESET.EXE.

     A few important notes about Data Sets:

     1) Installing a data set for an old version of LOD into a new version
        may not work. For example, installing FUTR361a.ZIP into LOD version
        4.00 could cause some strange problems. When you upgrade your
        version of LOD, you may wish to contact the author of the Data
        Set and request a newer copy.

     2) Installing a new data set into an old version of LOD may also
        cause trouble.


     3) You will probably need to restart (RESET.EXE) when switching
        to a new data set.


Unfinished Things
-----------------
     There are a lot of things that I really wanted to get done for this
version, but I just didn't get time. College is really taking up a lot of
time this semester and it's been hard to get time to work on LOD.
     Anyways, here is what isn't done:

     - Multiple grenade packs.

     - Several more special quests.

     - I wanted to add some more time limit stuff - 2-minute log off warnings,
       daily time limit features, etc, but I just didn't get the chance
       to finish them up for this version.

     - Multiple level maps - you walk into the nuclear missile base and
       there is a whole map to it, not just a menu.

     These are not things that are DISABLED, but rather are things which just
aren't completed. Most of them are at least partly enabled, but not fully
yet.
     I plan to work on these pretty soon - probably either version 4.20 or
5.00 depending on how many more enhancements I am able to complete.
     Also, remember, the more donations, the more incentive for me to get
this game finished! (grin)


Error Codes
-----------
       4    -  Too many open files (try adjusting the FILES= line in your
               config.sys file)

     100    -  Read past end of file. Something has gone wrong in one of
               the LOD data files. Please see "corrupted data files"
               below.

     200    -  Division by zero.

     203    -  Insufficient memory.

     205    -  Floating point overflow. Something has gone wrong in one
               of LOD's variables. You may need to reset the game, or
               possibly you could find the error with GAMEEDIT.EXE and
               correct it.

     252    -  Error while accessing EMS driver.

     253    -  Insufficient memory.

     254    -  Programming error [EAalloc block request > 16k]. This
               shouldn't happen!

"Corrupted" data files
----------------------
     It is possible that something could happen to your LOD data files. A
power outage, LOD crash, or other event could damage one of the data
files. For most of the files, LOD will display a "Data file is corrupted"
and the name of the file.
     If you get one of these messages, then the best thing to do is start
the game over with a clean copy of LOD.
     There are a few files which LOD can re-generate itself. CASSTATS.DAT
and DAYSTATS.DAT. If one of these is corrupted, then you can simply delete
the file and LOD will re-create it for you.

       various text files.

     - Major improvements to GMAPEDIT.

     - LGPL code is now demand paged into the system, reducing
       memory requirements by about 8k. The LGPL interpreter

       fonts (font8x8.fnt,font8x12.fnt,font8x14.fnt)

     - Rankings routine modified to use approx 5k less memory.

     - MAJOR BUG: The LGPL code was losing 4k of memory each
       time it was activated. This manifested itself mainly
       when players U)sed objects. Memory would run out,
       U)se object commands would do nothing, and rankings
       would refuse to display.

     - Added rankings profile to GT display

     - Added rankings listing to GT display

     - Added drop file to GT display (LOD only)

     - Added last lr scan to GT display

       strings.

     - Removed LASTGAMEDATA and LASTMISCDATA from GT code.
       Replaced them with a CRC check & variable which consumes
       a bit less memory.

     - Minor change to overlay init routine. If the filename
       cannot be determined from paramstr(0), then "GAME.OVR"
       will be tried. If that fails, then LOD will abort.

     - Added a pause after the "you have used up all your
       deaths today" message during logon.

     - Added LITE executables. Sound & graphics is hardcoded
       out for minimal memory usage.

     - Fixed a memory leak in the ANSI routines that was
       double-allocating ansi buffers.

     - Recoded "getmap" routine into assembly language for
       optimal speed.

     - [OS2] Added support for passing a serial port handle
       on the command line via "/SERHAND".

     - [OS2PM] Fixed incompatibility with CHRON. Possibly may
       have corrected compatibility problems with other programs
       as well.

 Version 5.00

     - Multiple map system. Up to 16 maps can be present in the game. Each
       map may be up to 125x125 in size. Transitions between maps may be
       implemented via the new pylon system, LGPL code, or various other
       "tricks".

       stores, taverns, etc. Configurable "passibility" type for terrain
       entries.

     - LGPL callbacks provided for ENTER and MOVEOK routines. LGPL programmers
       may now implement custom places to enter and create special
       requirements for players to fulfill before they can enter a particular
       terrain location (i.e. like the MiniRaft/Cryounit/etc)

     - [DEFAULT DATASET] A special city map is now used for Sacre Base, rather
       than the somewhat dull menu system.

     - [DEFAULT DATASET] Added "hell" level, an intermediate level required to
       get to BloodLust city.

     - Players may no longer "log off" at a city menu. They must now C)amp in

     - Monster definitions are now compiled by COMPILE.EXE into a binary
       format rather than a quasi-text format.

     - TALK definitions are now compiled into a binary format.

     - TAVERN.TXT has been removed. Tavern definitions are now specified in
       the "#" field of the TALK.TXT file. For example: "#TAV1 Defs Sacre".

     - Combat string table now stored in binary format in game.def rather
       than in text format.

     - [LGPL] Added data registry for user LGPL additions. The data registry
       allows dataset designers to "save" data to disk in LGPL code.

     - Added sample LGPL device: Warper Waypoint Bank. The waypoint bank
       allows the player to store several Warper Anchor Points and switch
       between them. Implemented in LGPL as an example/tutorial of the new
       registry functions.

     - Added sample LGPL device: HyperVault. The hypervault allows users to
       move items to/from a special hyperspace storage location. Implemented in

     - Major revisions to player doccumentation

     - LR-Scan and Scanner now report location of camped players.

     - Addition of shields. If configured in the "aux weapon" slot, then a
       shield will act as an additional piece of armor. Having a shield
       equipped also makes the P)arry command possible.

     - Removed HH, HS, HM, and HA codes from combat text. If a player has no
       weapon selected, then the WH/WS/WM/WA codes will be used and the
       weaponname supplied by %3/%4 will be set to the FISTNAME (defined in
       monster.txt) of the monster.

     - CSTATS combat ratings now take armor into account, as well ammo
       availability and weapon accurization.

     - The Hotels-R-Us rep will inform players of rent charges when they
       A)-camp on a map that charges rent.

     - Added the SSSS (Sam's Super Surplus Store). The primary purpose of the
       SSSS is to buy used items without the player having to run through the
       tedious process of navigating the cities :). The SSSS also has a daily
       special which is selected randomly during maintenance each night.

     - Friendly monsters. Specify "friendly xx" in monster.txt, where xx is
       the % chance of friendly status being set. Also use "friendtxt" lines
       to set friendly depart text.

     - Added W)arp, F)-depart as friends, Q)-equip, and M)-inv.maint options
       to LR combat menu.

     - Fixed problem with "BMPPUT slideshow" locking up sometimes.

     - Configurable menu system - see menu.txt. Most (if not all) game menus
       now operate via this system, so now you can move options around as
       you please.

     - Fixed bug with team discounts. Team discounts now require a team to
       have at least two players on it.

     - Raised length of terrain tile names from 12 characters to 16. Re-did

Where to reach me
-----------------
     I can usually be reached at my bbs system, which should be listed in the
 section entitled "registration" near the end of this document.

     Note: Since I am in college and do not have much time to hang around the
 house during the day, I prefer to answer all questions/comments via the
 bbs rather than my voice line.

     We also have a national land of devastation echomail area with the area
 tag "LAND". It is presently on the fidonet backbone.


Registration
------------
     If you or your users enjoy this game, then please send me in a
 registration/donation. I am currently a college student and programming
 my income is pretty scarce. To justify the time I spend programming
 and maintaining LOD, I really do need some compensation for my
 efforts. Donations of any amount are greatly welcome, but donations of
 $20 or more will be considered a registration.

     Due to my busy schedule (I am a full time student, plus I'm trying to
 handle a full time job), I don't have the time necessary to do all of the
 disk copying, addressing, mailing, etc required to send out updated
 copies of LOD to every registered user. In the past, I tried to send out the
 disks, but I always got behind, which meant the registered users got their
 packages late, and it lead to a real mess. Therefore, I have come up
 with what I believe to be a fair and efficient system.

     Here is what you do to register:

     #1: Send me $20 (or more!) in the mail. (Smaller donations are always
         appreciated, but I usually don't issue reg codes)

     #2: Call up my bbs about a week later and use the "Reg look" command to
         look up your registration code online. You don't need to be
         "validated" or "verified" or anything - you can get your code on
         your first logon.

     #3: Run the program REGISTER.EXE which will prompt you for the
         information and create lodreg.dat itself.

     When you have entered your registration code, the following will happen
 automatically:

     #1: Instead of saying "unregistered", the game will now say "Registered
         to <your name>".

     #2: The seven second delay and other registration nags will go away.

     #3: ACME Weapons will become functional.

     Included in the LOD distribution archives is a file called
 "REGISTER.FRM". This file contains a registration form which may be
 printed out and mailed to me with your donation. Filling out this form
 is optional, but it does provide me with some useful information
 about you and your system.

     Please note, under this policy I will not be mailing you a package in
 the mail. Please make your check payable to "Scott Baker" and send it to
 the address below.

     Please send registrations to the following address:

     Scott Baker
     2241 W Labriego
     Tucson, Az 85741

     You may call the following to use Reg look to look up your reg code about
 a week after you have mailed the donation:

     The Not-Yet-Named bbs (USA)
     (520) 544-4655  (USR Dual - 14.4kbaud max)            Fidonet 1:300/9
     (520) 797-8573  (USR Sportster v.34 - 28.8kbaud max)  Fidonet 1:300/29

     You can also try connecting with my homepage on the web at the url:
 "http://www.primenet.com/~smbaker". I have provided an online method to
 lookup regcodes there.

     Reminder: You WILL NOT be mailed a letter with your registration code.
 Just allow an appropriate amount of time (a week or so) after dropping your
 check in the mail for it to arrive to me and then give my bbs a call as
 outlined above. The process to get your Reg Code is really very simple and
 takes no time at all.
