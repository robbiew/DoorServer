       Please encourage your sysop to register this software. LODrespresents many hours of work and I desperately need compenstationto continue the porject. Only through the generosity of responsiblesysops can this project continue.       The requested registration fee is $20. After your sysop sendsin the fee, his personal key will be waiting in about a week on theLOD support bbs (520-544-4655).       If you enjoy LOD, then how about registering it for yoursysop? Or banding together with other users to get together aregistration?       The money really helps out in the way of funding the workon LOD. As many of you know, in addition to working on LOD, I am alsoa full time college student. My time is scarce and I can only continuethis project if I know that there are those out there willing tosupport it.       When registered, the seven second delay upon entering and exitingLOD will go away, plus you will gain access to the new "ACME Weapons"advanced weapons shop located in the wastelands.       Please note: registrations may take a week or so to process,so please don't rag on your sysop too much if the registrationis not processed immediately (call me up and bother me (grin))       Scott Baker, Author of LOD and GTERM.       Note: Tucson's area code just changed from 602 to 520. If you know             of anyone who is having trouble locating the LOD support             bbs, please inform them of the new number (520-544-4655)       Hello, This is an automatic message from Scott Baker, author ofLand of Devastation. There are a few issues that I would like to pointout about this version of LOD.       - I am going to institute a new BUGFIX policy. From now on, whenever         bugs are fixed, I am going to re-release the entire distribution         package of LOD. Since the package is very large (approx 5 megs),         I will also release a bugfix upgrade, with a filename convention         as follows:           Lxxx-yyy.zip  where xxx is the original version and yyy is                         the new version.         For example, L410-411.ZIP would upgrade version 4.10 to version         4.11 when version 4.11 becomes available. It is my hope that         these upgrades will be small in size and thus lessen the strain         placed on sysops.         If you notice any bugs with this version, then you may wish         to contact the Not-Yet-Named bbs at 520-544-4655 and look for         an upgrade file. Full details will be present on the bbs.       - OS/2 and DPMI versions of LOD are available. OS/2, Windows,         and DPMI versions of GTERM are currently under way, and I hope         to have them available in a month or two.       - The official Land of Devastation echo area (echo tag LAND) is now         available on the Fidonet backbone. Have your sysop request it         today!       - I have setup a home page on the WWW. It is at the url         "http://www.primenet.com/~smbaker". LOD information and files may         be found there.       I would like to thank all of you out there for your continued supportof LOD. The vast amount of comments and suggestions that I have receivedhave really helped to make this game a success.       Scott Baker, Author of LOD
