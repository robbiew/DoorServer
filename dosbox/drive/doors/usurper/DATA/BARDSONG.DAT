#Title "Blood of heroes"
Ladies and gents, we're still alive
by the skin of our teeth, now it's killing time
angel in our pocket, devil by our side
we ain't going nowhere cuz' heroes never die
it's time to be immortal, 'cuz heroes never die

#Title "Lesser God"
damned to a ghostly substance
   created by a lesser god
damned to carry this burden
   forever in your sour souls
damned to dig on rotten roots
   you are doomed and none shall live
the essence that keeps you alive
   nothing but venom injected by wrath

#Title "Dragon of Time"
on cold landscapes of ghostly substance
the dragon spreads its wings
the only dragon, creator of time
on paths where
once surrounded by night
throned the dragon of time now dwells
the swords dipped in blood
stone cold, washed away by time
none shall live and all shall die
immortal we stand
on the hills where the dragon flies
on the hills where dragon flies

#Title "Blood Song"
Drinking blood
a red delightful bloody power
my fatal bite
the art of the blackest hour
I suck your blood
an immense evlasting lust
morning grows
the sun burns me to dust

#Comment This is a War-Song Song, Jakob Dangarden
#Title "Burial Song of Th‚oden"
Out of doubt, out of dark, to the day's rising
he rode singing in the sun, sword unsheathing.
Hope he rekindled, and in hope ended;
over death, over dread, over doom lifted
out of loss, out of life, unto long glory.

#Comment This is a War-Song Song, Jakob Dangarden
#Title "Athelas"
When the black breath blows
and death's shadow grows
and all lights pass,
come athelas! come athelas!
Life to the dying
In the king's hand lying!
#Level 7

#Title "Song of Lebennin"
Silver flow the streams from Celos to Erui
In the green fields of Lebennin!
Tall grows the grass there. In the wind from the Sea
The white lilies sway,
And the golden bells are shaken of mallos and alfirin
In the green fields of Lebennin,
In the wind from the Sea!

#Title "River Daughter"
O slender as the willow-wand! O clearer than clear water!
O reed by the living pool! Fair River-daughter!
O spring-time and summer-time, and spring again after!
O wind on the waterfall, and the leaves' laughter!
#Level 9

#Title "Song in the tower"
In western lands beneath the Sun
the flowers may rise in Spring,
the trees may bud, the waters run,
the merry finches sing.
Or there maybe 'tis cloudless night
and swaying beeches bear
the Elven-stars as jewels white
amid their branching hair.
#Level 10
#Comment This is a War-Song Song, Jakob Dangarden
#Title "Star Tower"
Though here at journey's end I lie
in darkness buried deep,
beyond all towers strong and high,
beyond all mountains steep,
above all shadows rides the Sun
and Stars for ever dwell:
I will not say the Day is done,
nor bid the Stars farewell.
#Level 11
#Comment This is a War-Song Song, Jakob Dangarden
#Title "Wishful"
The cold hard lands
they bites our hands,
they gnaws our feet.
The rocks and stones
are like old bones
all bare of meat.
But stream and pool
is wet and cool:
so nice to feet!
And now we wish-
#Level 12
#Comment This is a War-Song Song, Jakob Dangarden
#Title "A Rhyme of Lore"
Tall ships and tall kings
Three times three,
What brought they from the foundered land
Over the flowing sea?
Seven stars and seven stones
And one white tree.
#Level 13
#Comment This is a War-Song Song, Jakob Dangarden
#Title "Gandalf's Riddle of the Ents
Ere iron was found or tree was hewn,
When young was mountain under moon;
Ere ring was made, or wrought was woe,
It walked the forests long ago.
#Level 14

#Title "Beechen Leaf"
When Spring unfolds the beechen leaf, and sap is in the bough;
When light is on the wild-wood stream, and wind is on the brow;
When stride is long, and breath is deep, and keen the mountain-air,
Come back to me! Come back to me, and say my land is fair!
