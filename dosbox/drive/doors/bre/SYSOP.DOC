Hello, Sysop!

Just what IS BRE?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Barren Realms Elite is a 25-player strategic war-game.  The setting is in
the future - nuclear destruction has spread throughout the planet, and now
only a vast barren void exists.  You, as a baron under a great king, must
expand your barony throughout the planet, taking advantage of natural
resources such as rivers and mountains to become the ultimate baron.  This
task is not easy though -- you must keep your population content, while
maintaining a military large enough to defend your empire against other
barons.  You must balance size and strength, attack, trade with, and
make alliances with other barons.  Pirates throughout the planet will
constantly plunder the great leaders -- making your job even harder.
  But there's one more enemy you may face.  Barren Realms Elite's Inter-
BBS capabilities allow you to hook up with up to 254 other BBS's for head-
to-head competition.  Expand alliances throughout the world - the real
world - and work as a team fighting for your king and planet.

  BRE is a simple to play and learn game, and it's very configurable so
the sysop can make his/her game unique.  We have tried to make BRE as
simple to install and maintain as possible, and neither the Inter-BBS or
Local play really requires any maintainence by the sysop.  We hope you
run and enjoy this game!  Thanks!

Upgrading from an older version of BRE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Just UNARJ the BRE?????.ARJ file and run UNPACK.BAT.  Your old game will
still work (most cases), but sometimes certain features of the new game may
not work correctly.  A RESET will enable all features of the new version to
work, but until then you can still continue your old game.  Also, read
UPGRADE.DOC for information on special changes for upgrades.

Installing a new copy of BRE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Welcome to Barren Realms Elite.  We've attempted to make installing ANY
SRGame as simple as possible...
Here are the steps:

  1.  Type UNPACK to unpack all of BRE's game files into their proper
      directories

  2.  Type INSTALL BRE to set up the doorfile information and create a
      batch file.

         The doorfile information allows BRE to interpret the doorfile
         created by the BBS every time it runs a door.  Currently there
         is support for RBBS, GAP, WWIV, Wildcat, GT Power, PCBoard,
         and Spitfire door files.
         The corresponding filenames are DORINFO1.DEF, DOOR.SYS, CHAIN.TXT,
         CALLINFO.BBS, GTUSER.BBS, PCBOARD.SYS, and SFDOORS.DAT.  If you need
         another format, read SRDOOR.DOC.

         It explains the options:
           þ Write a replacement for SRDOOR that handles your door format.
           þ Insert a door file converter program before SRDOOR.
           þ Send us your door file format and specify which lines contain:
             ¯ Name (First AND Last, or Entire)
             ¯ COM port number
             ¯ baud rate
             ¯ IBM graphics characters enabled?  (optional information)
             ¯ ANSI enabled?                     (optional information)
             ¯ Number of lines on the screen     (optional information)
             ¯ Time limit (in minutes)           (optional information)

  3.  Install the door to run the batch file (BRE.BAT) from the BBS.
      (See your BBS manual if you do not know how to do this.)

  4.  RESET the game with "BRE RESET".       *** VERY IMPORTANT ***

  5.  You may wish to view the RESOURCE.DOC file for information on
      customizing or modifying your game setup.  This is especially
      important for high speed BBSes with comport locking.

  6.  If you are having troubles, first run "BRE TEST" to see the basic
      configuration setup.  Then, check DOCS\Q&A.TXT.

  7.  If you wish to setup an Inter-BBS Game, see IPSETUP.DOC

  8.  After Installation, you can remove the following files, as they
      are unnecessary for game play:

      BRE.CFG
      INSTALL.EXE
      UNPACK.BAT
      UPGRADE.DOC
      BREDATA.EXE
      WHATS.NEW    <-- We recommend you view this file if you have time :)
