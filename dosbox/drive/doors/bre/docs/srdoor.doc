ÄÄÄ[SRDOOR 3.1]ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Purpose:
         This program reads a BBS door file and converts it into a standard
         Solar Realms format file called DOORFILE.SR.  This one program will
         work with SRE, SCE, AC6, LEA, PC, BRE, FE, and any other games from
         the Solar Realm.  The purpose of an external door conversion is to
         allow sysops of BBSes not supported by SRDOOR to use another program
         to convert to the DOORFILE.SR file.  For example, if you were
         running a BBS that produced USER.DAT as a door file, and SRDOOR
         did not support it, you could write a program to replace SRDOOR
         that would read USER.DAT and convert it to DOORFILE.SR.  See the
         section, "File Format".

Format:
	 SRDOOR [®specialbbstype¯ [®comport¯]]
	  or
	 SRDOOR -f ®filename¯

         The parameters "specialbbstype" and "comport" are required for
         certain BBS types.  See the "File Format" section for more
         information.

	 The -f option allows you to choose a setup file other than SETUP.SR.

         or

	 (writing the doorfile directly)

	 ECHO ®username¯	 >DOORFILE.SR
	 ECHO ®ansi-status¯	>>DOORFILE.SR
	 ECHO ®ibm-char-status¯ >>DOORFILE.SR
	 ECHO ®page-length¯	>>DOORFILE.SR
	 ECHO ®baud-rate¯	>>DOORFILE.SR
	 ECHO ®com-port¯	>>DOORFILE.SR
	 ECHO ®time-limit¯	>>DOORFILE.SR

	 For example, if your BBS passes as command line parameters
	 the username in %1, the com port in %2, the baud rate in %3,
	 and the time limit in %4, but doesn't pass the others, you
	 could write into your batch file (instead of SRDOOR):

	 ECHO %1   >DOORFILE.SR
	 ECHO -1  >>DOORFILE.SR
	 ECHO -1  >>DOORFILE.SR
	 ECHO -1  >>DOORFILE.SR
	 ECHO %3  >>DOORFILE.SR
	 ECHO %2  >>DOORFILE.SR
	 ECHO %4  >>DOORFILE.SR

	 (The -1 means "I don't know this value"; you can use this for
	 ANSI, pagelength, IBM character status, and Time Limit.)

Setup:
         Use the INSTALL program to set up a batch file.  It will
         automatically run SRDOOR.

         If you have a non-supported BBS, these are some options:
            1.  Use a doorfile converter to convert to a supported format
                (DOOR.SYS or DORINFO1.DEF preferred)
            2.  Write a program to read your doorfile and write DOORFILE.SR;
                if you do this, please send us your program so that we may
                incorporate it into future versions of SRDOOR. (see below)
	    3.	Use command-line parameters to write directly to DOORFILE.SR.
		(See above for an example.)

Compatibility:
         We have tested SRDOOR with DOOR.SYS and DORINFO1.DEF; we have not
         been able to test it with the other door types.  If you have any
         useful information, please send it to us!  Also, the tests we
         have done were for DOOR.SYS produced by Telegard, not Wildcat,
         software.

File Format:
         SRDOOR reads text files in which one piece of information is on
         each line.  Unfortunately, some BBS programs do not create these
         types of door files.  For standard door files, view SETUP.SR for
         more information.  For a non-standard door file, SRDOOR currently
         has experimental GTUSER and PCBOARD modes:

            SRDOOR PCBOARD1
               Converts PCBoard 14.x type PCBOARD.SYS files to DOORFILE.SR.
            SRDOOR PCBOARD2 ®comport¯
               Converts PCBoard 12.1 type PCBOARD.SYS files to DOORFILE.SR.
            SRDOOR GTUSER ®comport¯
               Converts GT type GTUSER.BBS files to DOORFILE.SR.

         Notice that the parameter ®comport¯ is needed in the Old PC-Board
         and GT-USER files.  Use the COM port that the modem is attached to
         (1, 2, 3, or 4).

         You can also write your own program to convert your favorite door
         file to DOORFILE.SR.  The DOORFILE.SR format is:

            <line 1):   Complete name of user
            (line 2):   ANSI status:  1 = yes, 0 = no, -1 = don't know
            (line 3):   IBM Graphic characters:  1 = yes, 0 = no, -1 = unknown
            (line 4):   Page length of screen, in lines.  Assume 25 if unknown
            (line 5):   Baud Rate:  300, 1200, 2400, 9600, 19200, etc.
            (line 6):   Com Port:  1, 2, 3, or 4.
            (line 7):   Time Limit:  (in minutes); -1 if unknown.

         There is a program called GENPC that does this for Genesis Deluxe
         BBS software.

Bugs:
         <> Not tested for BBS types other than DOOR.SYS and DORINFO1.DEF.

         <> PCBOARD 14.x support not working.

Bug Fixes:
         <> 38400 support now FINALLY works!

Online Game Writers:
         We at the Solar Realm encourage you to use this door file format.
         We feel it has all the necessary information for a door game.  It
         also has the advantage of being easy to read in a variety of
         languages (unlike many door files being used that require BASIC,
         Pascal, or C).  By using an external door conversion program, you
         leave open the option for sysops to write their own converter so that
         those sysops who have BBSes that your game does not support may be
         able to find or write a replacement for SRDOOR.

Usage:
         If any person wishes to use this program for any other legal use,
         the only requirement is that she or he write a letter to the Solar
         Realm BBS informing them that SRDOOR is being used.  Please describe
         your project.  We are interested in keeping track of all persons
         using SRDOOR (for upgrade notices and information purposes).  No
         charge is required to use SRDOOR, and no fee may be charged for its
         distribution.  This documentation file must accompany SRDOOR.
