Many sysops are unwilling to setup the InterBBS Gaming System, are unsure
of its workings, or are unwilling to connect to another system.  This file
explains how to set up several local games to be interconnected so you
may essentially run an "InterBBS Local Game".

This can be especially interesting if you have a large number of players on
the board who wish to form "teams" and fight, etc.

How to do this:

  See the INTERBBS.DOC for basic information on how to set up your BRNODES.DAT
  and BBS.CFG files.

  BRNODES.DAT:
  컴컴컴컴컴컴
    Each game should have a different Nodelist number and name.  For
    simplicity, it is recommended that you use 1:1/1 for the first game,
    1:1/2 for the second, and so forth.

  BBS.CFG:
  컴컴컴컴
    For all games (2..n), the INBOUND FILES directory should be:
      [GAME(N-1)]\OUTBOUND
    For game #1, the INBOUND FILES directory should be:
      [GAME(N)]\OUTBOUND

    For example: Suppose you have a 4-game setup in directories C:\BRE1,
      C:\BRE2, C:\BRE3, and C:\BRE4.
      Game            Inbound File Directory
      1               C:\BRE4\OUTBOUND
      2               C:\BRE1\OUTBOUND
      3               C:\BRE2\OUTBOUND
      4               C:\BRE3\OUTBOUND

  ROUTE.CFG:
  컴컴컴컴컴
  All systems should route data to the next system, with the last routing
  all data to game #1.  For a 4-game system, you should have the following:

    Game 1 should have a route.cfg with: "ROUTE * 2"
    Game 2 should have a route.cfg with: "ROUTE * 3"
    Game 3 should have a route.cfg with: "ROUTE * 4"
    Game 4 should have a route.cfg with: "ROUTE * 1"

  This basically produces a file circle.  Run FE PLANETARY on each system 1훫
  in order, and all the necessary information will be properly transmitted
  between systems.  Running this cycle twice will produce immediate results of
  all attacks, etc.

SAMPLE FILES (for a 4-Game System)
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴
This assumes a 4-game system, with a league number of 900.  The four games
are contained in C:\BRE1, C:\BRE2, C:\BRE3, and C:\BRE4.
