Q) My game just isn't running properly.
A) Try running BRE TEST and viewing the file it creates (RESULTS.TXT) for
   more information.

Q) BRE shows up fine locally but not remotely.
A) Be sure, for high speed modems, to specify a locked baud rate parameter
   in BRE's RESOURCE.DAT file.  For example, if your modem is locked at
   19200, enter:
                        LockedBaud      19200
   in the RESOURCE.DAT file.

   Also, try changing the Fossil driver setting in RESOURCE.DAT:
                        Fossil          yes
   or
                        Fossil          no
   Some systems may work better when BRE uses the Fossil, and some may
   work better when BRE uses its own communication routines.

   If you are using a non-standard COM port, and you are not using a
   Fossil driver, you may wish to tell BRE what the COM port parameters
   are.  Check RESOURCE.DOC for details on how to do this.

Q) My game is running fairly slow and choppy.  Why?
A) The BRE multitasking routines are still being worked on.  They work well
   on some systems, but not others.  Try adding "Multitasker NONE" to your
   RESOURCE.DAT file.

Q) I keep getting a message saying "Not a member of a league" when I run
   BRE PLANETARY or OUTBOUND or INBOUND.  Why?
A) 2 possible reasons.  One, you're really not a member of league and shouldn't
   be running those options.  More likely, you have an error in your setup.
   Make sure your node number in the BRNODES.DAT matches exactly the one in
   BBS.CFG.

Q) I keep getting a Run Time Error.  What do I do?
A) First, carefully check your setup and make sure you haven't goofed anywhere.
   If that does not help, write down the error number (201 at 2145:2314) and
   send it to Mehul Patel at Solaria City (Fido: 1:106/900).  If your game
   seems dead, you can try copying the BACKUP\GAME.DAT over your DATA\GAME.DAT
   and see if that fixes the problem.

Q) I am currently the coordinator of a league.  I wish to make another board
   into the new coordinator.  How do I go about this?
A) First, you must change the BRNODES.DAT to make the new BBS into system #1.
   Additionally, you must copy your COORD.KEY file from your main BRE directory
   to the other system's main BRE directory.  Do *NOT* allow anyone to access
   this file, as it prevents systems from becoming "fake" coordinators and
   messing up a league.

Q) I keep receiving all my attacks back as Lost In Transit.  Why?
A) Either the routing between you and your opponent is too long (making BRE
   think the attack was lost forever) or there is a routing problem.  In the
   case of the first, either find a new, more efficient method of routing or
   ask the coordinator to increase the number of days before assuming an
   attack is lost.  In the latter case, ask your coordinator to run
   "BRE ROUTEINFO" to produce a list of the current routing setup and find
   and help solve any problems in the current routing scheme.

Q) As a coordinator for a BRE League, I keep getting complaints of people
   cheating.  What should I do?
A) Most cheat-complaints are false alarms, but the occasional one may be true.
   Depending on the set up of a game, empires may or may not be able to grow
   at unbelievable rates, and so it is very difficult to tell whether or not
   an empire really is cheating.  It's a judgement call you must make.

Q) I sent my registration quite a while ago, but have received nothing back.
   What does this mean?
A) If it has been less than 4 weeks, please do not ask about it because it
   will only slow us down more having to sift through all the e-mail.  If it
   has been more than 4 weeks, you may wish to Fido-net or Email Amit or Mehul
   at Solaria City, but don't expect an immediate reply because we have
   very limited time and cannot get to all mail immediately.

Q) How do I set up BRE for my multinode board?
A) BRE cannot run on more than one node at a time, but it will detect this
   automatically, so that you do not have to use external utilities or
   semaphore files to do this.

   To set up BRE for a multinode board, first install BRE normally, for
   just node 1.  Then, look in your BRE directory for a file called
   SETUP.SR.  This file contains the path to the door file.  You can make
   copies of this file for each node (SETUP.1, SETUP.2, SETUP.3, etc.).

   In your BBS directory, there will be a BRE.BAT file.  Edit this file
   and look for a line:
                        SRDOOR
   change this line to
                        SRDOOR -f SETUP.%NODE%
   This assumes that you have an environment variable "NODE" that contains
   the node number (1, 2, 3, etc.).  If, instead, your node number is passed
   on the command line, you can use a line such as
                        SRDOOR -f SETUP.%1

   In addition, your nodes may not have the same locked baud rate.  If
   this is the case, one solution is to make a RESOURCE.1, RESOURCE.2,
   and so on.  Then, in each one, you can set a different locked baud rate.
   In the batch file, before BRE runs, add the line
                        COPY RESOURCE.%NODE% RESOURCE.DAT

   Good luck!

Q) BRE shows up fine locally but not remotely.
A) Be sure, for high speed modems, to specify a locked baud rate parameter
   in BRE's RESOURCE.DAT file.  For example, if your modem is locked at
   19200, enter:
                        LockedBaud      19200
   in the RESOURCE.DAT file.

   Also, try changing the Fossil driver setting in RESOURCE.DAT:
                        Fossil          yes
   or
                        Fossil          no
   Some systems may work better when BRE uses the Fossil, and some may
   work better when BRE uses its own communication routines.

   If you are using a non-standard COM port, and you are not using a
   Fossil driver, you may wish to tell BRE what the COM port parameters
   are.  Check RESOURCE.DOC for details on how to do this.

Generic A) Check RESOURCE.DOC, as it has dozens of options relating to game
           play, more effective running of the game, non standard IRQ's,
           fossil drivers, locked bauds, and everything else you could imagine.
