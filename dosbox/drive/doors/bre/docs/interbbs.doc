Setting up Inter횭BS warfare in Barren Realms Elite involves a very simple
process.  In general (with exceptions), it requires an external netmail
system such as Frontdoor, Binkley, or Dbridge.

Following these steps should make the process of becoming a part of an
InterBBS Interactive BRE game as easy as possible.

Step #1:
     Decide whether you would like to create your own league or join another.
     If you have not had any experience with InterBBS games, it is a good
     idea to consider first joining another.  A "League" is a set of systems
     which are all linked together, with a "League Coordinator" being the
     sysop of the system in charge.  It is that person that you should
     contact about joining a game.  They are always BBS #1 in a List of BBSes
     in the game.  If you do not already have a particular league in mind,
     you can get more information on leagues by freqing or downloading
     LEAGUE.LST from Solaria City BBS.  Alternatively, you can call the BBS
     and get detailed information on several of the larger leagues in the
     game.  Once you have contacted the central BBS, you will receive an
     BRNODES.DAT file.  Check to make sure your BBS is in it with the
     correct node number.  IF YOU CHOOSE TO CREATE YOUR OWN LEAGUE, THERE
     IS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BELOW.

Step #2:
     At this point you should have, or be expecting, to get an BRNODES.DAT
     file.  You need to create a BBS.CFG file in one of the following ways:
       Method #1 - Run "BRE SETUPINTERBBS" and input all of the necessary
                   information.  If you do not know the League Number yet,
                   you will need to modify this to join the game (find
                   out from your League Coordinator)
       Method #2 - Create it yourself.  Look at SAMPLES\BBS.SAM for more
                   details about the format - it is extremely simple.

Step #3:
     You now have an BRNODES.DAT and BBS.CFG file.  You should find out from
     your League Coordinator whether or not you need to create a ROUTE.CFG
     file.  Your league may already take care of routing in the BRNODES.DAT
     through a HOST routing system, in which case you may skip this step.
     Otherwise, look at the SAMPLES\ROUTE.SAM for more information about how
     to set up your own routing information.  Note that even if you are
     letting the League Coordinator set up the proper routing, if you want
     mail to be placed CRASH or HOLD, you will need to set that in your
     ROUTE.CFG file.

Step #4:
     Run "BRE PLANETARY" to your daily maintenance.  You may also run this
     more often in order to process data several times a day.  Alternatively,
     you may run "BRE FULL" instead of "BRE" when users play and the game will
     process data when the user is playing.
     Run "BRE SCORES" in your daily maintenance to ensure the daily creation
     of the InterBBS scores files.

Step #5:
     Well, you're almost done.  You should have the BRNODES.DAT, BBS.CFG, and
     ROUTE.CFG (optional) files now.  Run "BRE TEST" and make sure everything
     looks OK.  If so, you should be all set.  Enjoy the game!  If not,
     you'll need to backtrack to see what happened.  Here are some possible
     problems:

     Problem: "Not a member of InterBBS League"
     Solutions:
       * Check to make sure BBS.CFG and BRNODES.DAT are properly named
         and in the main BRE directory
       * Check to make sure your Node Number in each of those files
         matches exactly

     Problem: The routing from BRE TEST is not what I want
     Solutions:
       * If you're using the HOST system defined by your League Coordinator,
         contact him or her and let him know
       * If you're using the ROUTE.CFG file, check to make sure you typed
         everything in properly.


Becoming a League Coordinator
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

In addition to the above steps, as League Coordinator, you will be responsible
for creating and maintaining the BRNODES.DAT file and the league in general.
This involves adding new systems, deleting old ones, checking the routing,
and ensuring fairness.  For information on the format of the BRNODES.DAT
file, see SAMPLES\NODEFORM.INF.  We highly recommend you use the HOST routing
method so that other systems do not need to worry about their own routing.

You will also need to be sure to select a League Number between 1 and 999.
This number identifies your league so BBSes running multiple games can be
kept separated.  It is OK to have 2 leagues with the same number, but no
single system can be a member of both of those leagues.

Transferring Coordinatorship

  If you would like to hand over the job of coordinatorship in your league
  to another BBS, you must copy the COORD.KEY file to the BRE directory of
  the new BBS and make him BBS #1 in the BRNODES.DAT file.
