TEST                               This does a basic self-diagnostic test
                                   on your setup of BRE.  It may help find
                                   basic problems in your setup of the game.

                                   installed

                                   Delete them, and change their UserNames

/LOCKED=#####                      This will set a Locked Baud Rate to #####

                                   for local play though

IPSETUP                            This will automatically set up your
                                   BBS.CFG file if you'd like.  You
                                   can also use a text editor to create
                                   this file.  This file is necessary for
                                   InterPlanetary play.

PLANETARY                          Daily Maintainence for Inter-Planetary
                                   Warfare - This can be multiple times during
                                   the day to speed gameplay up by reading
                                   inbound and creating outbound datafiles.

INBOUND                            Runs only INBOUND section of BRE Planetary.
                                   If you want to run BRE PLANETARY after each
                                   play, run BRE INBOUND before BRE.EXE
                                   NOTE:  This will also ROUTE outbound files.
                                   The INBOUND command can be used with any
                                   mailer system.

OUTBOUND                           Same as Inbound, except run AFTER BRE.EXE
                                   Only processes OUTBOUND files.

                                   combining BRE INBOUND, a player, and
                                   BRE OUTBOUND into one step.
                                   Equivalent to running:
                                     BRE INBOUND
                                     BRE
                                     BRE OUTBOUND

                                   Updates to All Nodes to make sure all
                                   nodes have the same config.  Automatically

                                   that are sent out.  Used with PLANETARY,
                                   OUTBOUND, and INBOUND options.

                                   option is only available to the League
                                   Coordinator.
