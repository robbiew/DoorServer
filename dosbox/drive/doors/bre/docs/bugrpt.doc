Barren Realms Elite - Bug Report Information
--------------------------------------------

  If you have any bugs to report, please try the following:

  1) If it is VERY important, and most likely unreported, you can send
     EMail to: mpatel@mail.utexas.edu

  2) Use the SR-Games echo.  Write a message either to Mehul or to All
     with a specific subject line about the bug.  This is the best route
     and most likely to get a helpful response.

  3) Last resort, you may send netmail.  This is NOT read often, though,
     and do not expect any type of quick response.

In all cases, we cannot guarantee a response of any sort due to limited
time on our part.  We are trying to fix bugs and get a clean version out
as quickly as possible.  In all cases, please include your system setup
(multitasking, modem speed, # of nodes, etc) as well as the version of
BRE you are using.

                                          Thanks,
                                          Mehul Patel
