  ^\08--------------

  ^\0EThe Input System^\07: BRE supports a (hopefully) friendly input system to make
  playing a bit easier.  At any numeric prompt, you may press ^\0F>^\07 to select the
  maximum value.  You may also use ^\0Fm^\07 and ^\0Fk^\07 to add 6 or 3 zeros respectively,
  ie, Mega or Kilo.

  ^\0EThe Help System^\07: At several of the menus, pressing ^\0F?^\07 will bring up a help
  menu allowing you to get more information on each of the selections.  This
  will hopefully help the newcomers to the game get acquainted fairly quickly.

  ^\0EThe System Menu^\07: From the buy menu of the game, pressing ^\0F*^\07 will bring
  up a system menu with several options.  This menu can be very helpful in
  returning to previous menus or accessing miscellaneous items unavailable
  elsewhere.

  ^\0EPreferences^\07: From the System Menu and main Game Menu, you may
  set a variety of options to automate some of the features of the game and
  to skip certain menus to speed up play.
