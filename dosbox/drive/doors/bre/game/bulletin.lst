^README
Hello!  Welcome to Barren Realms Elite, the first InterBBS SRGame!  This game
gives a whole new meaning to Online Gaming.  Not only do you fight local
players as in most games, but now you can challenge up to 254 other BBSes
around the country playing head to head - BBS vs BBS combat.  Not only must
you perfect your own strategies to become the ultimate player, but you also
must work as a team with your BBS, make alliances with others, and control
the world - the real world.
^END

^IPSTRATEGY
There is only one requirement to be a good InterBBS team: Teamwork.
Keep constant communications flowing between other players on your BBS and
and other BBS's - Make allies on other BBS's.  You should have a high team
spirit if you want a good success rate-Teamwork.  If players attack each
other in the game, warn them not to.  If they continue, ally your BBS and
destroy them.  To be the best in the league, you'll need a high amount
of team cooperation.  Do not allow anybody to dictate the BBS; make it a
team effort.  You may even wish to designate public relations people, local
coordinators, etc, etc.  Whatever you do, be a team.  Good luck in the world
of BBS Warfare!
