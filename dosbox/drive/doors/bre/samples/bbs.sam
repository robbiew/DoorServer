Sample BBS.CFG file

NOTE:  The BBS.CFG file should be stored in your main BRE directory

Line 1 = Sysop Name
Line 2 = BBS Name or Planet Name - This is used only to identify your
         planet in the game, so use whatever you like - to make others
         see the selected name, request that it be placed in the Nodelist
         in place of the BBS name
Line 3 = NodeNumber WITH Net/Node ONLY - Include the ZONE *only* if it is
         included in the BRNODES.DAT file.  Zones should be used is the
         zone number is greater than one - be sure to get your coordinator
         to place it in the BRNODES.DAT.
Line 4 = Your Front End Incoming FILE Directory
Line 5 = Your NetMail Directory
Line 6 = League number - Must be the same throughout the league.  This
         can be any number between 1 and 999.  It is used if a BBS wishes
         to be a member of two leagues to separate incoming files.
         I suggest league coordinators pick a unique number for their league
         to avoid confusion with other leagues.  Support for this has been
         installed and you will need this number whether running one or more
         games.  Enjoy!
Line 7 = Your Front End Mailer
         This should be one of the following:
         FRONTDOOR   BINKLEY   DBRIDGE   INTERMAIL   DBRIDGEOLD   OTHER   NONE
         If you wish to run BRE PLANETARY more than once a day, you MUST
         be running Front Door, Binkleyterm, D'Bridge, or Intermail.
         D'Bridge 1.51 and below do not support the necessary features for
         BRE to allow multiple files per day to be transferred, and you must
         therefore use the "DBRIDGEOLD" setting.
         If you run D'Bridge 1.51- or OTHER, then be SURE to only run
         BRE PLANETARY during daily maintainence.  Otherwise, you will lose
         Data.
         Also, many systems are running BRE *without* a mail system
         completely (no idea how, but they have succeeded!).  You can use
         the NONE setting if you delete files after they are sent.
         Selecting NONE will *not* create a .MSG file.
