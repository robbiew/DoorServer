;InterBBS Routing Configuration File ***SAMPLE***
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------
;NOTE:If your League Coordinator is managing your routing through HOST
;     routing system in the nodelist, you do not need a ROUTE.CFG file.
;     However, any information in this file will override anything else
;     assumed by the BRNODES.DAT file.
;
;NOTE:The ACTUAL Config file MUST be named ROUTE.CFG if you have one.
;     The ROUTE.CFG file must be stored in the main FE Directory
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------
;Barren Realms Elite InterBBS supports the following features:
;
;ROUTING
;  If you wish to route data destined to a particular node to
;  another node, use the following format:
;  ROUTE 5 10
;  This (Without the ;) will route all mail for BBS #5 in your BRNODES.DAT to
;    BBS #10
;  ROUTE also supports "*" as the first parameter to represent "ALL":
;  ROUTE * 8
;  This (Without the ;) will route ALL mail for ANY BBS through BBS #8
;  Using ROUTE 5 5 after a "Route * #" command will restore BBS #5 to Direct
;
;CRASH PRIORITY MAIL
;  By default, all FE mail is set to "Normal Priority" in your mailer.  If you
;  wish for BRE to set mail up to CRASH Priority, use the following format:
;  CRASH 5
;  This (Without the ;) will put all mail to BBS #5 as CRASH Mail
;  CRASH * with set crash priority to ALL nodes
;
;HOLD MAIL
;  The format to put mail on HOLD is the same as CRASH.
;  HOLD 5
;  HOLD * with put mail on hold to ALL nodes
;
;NORMAL MAIL
;  The format to put mail on NORMAL mode, cancelling crash & hold priorities.
;  NORMAL 5
;  NORMAL * with put mail on NORMAL for ALL nodes
;
;You may put these lines in this file at any location and in any order.
